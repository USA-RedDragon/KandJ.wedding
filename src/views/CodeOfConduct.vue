          <h2>Summed up: "Don't be a dick"</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Be welcoming to everyone.</li>
            <li>Be considerate.</li>
            <li>Be respectful.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow guests.</li>
            <li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language are not allowed.</li>
            <li>No personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
            <li>Do not harass others. If someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
            <li>Any physical violence or intimidation, threatened or acted on, is a crime.</li>
            <li>Respect and use preferred pronouns. This is a zero-tolerance rule.</li>
            <li>Offensive comments related to gender or gender identity are not allowed.</li>
            <li>You can record or take pictures, but please refrain from posting any on social media
              until after the wedding ceremony.</li>
            <li>Do not harass or otherwise impede the photographer.</li>
            <li>Please do not bring children. Exceptions can be made by contacting the bride or groom.</li>
            <li>Contact the bride or groom for plus ones. The venue is small and we have a limited amount
              of seating and food.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Violations of these rules will result in being asked to leave.
            Failure to leave is considered trespass.</p>
          <p>Disagreements happen, but are not an excuse for poor behavior and bad manners.
            When disagreements do happen, work together to solve them effectively in a way that
            ensures everyone's day is wonderful.</p>
          <p>Not everyone will understand jokes, sarcasm, oblique references, colloquialisms, or
            euphemisms in the same way you do. Always empathize with the other parties and recognize
            they may come from a different background and interpret words differently than you.</p>
          <p>Sexist, racist, or other prejudicial or exclusionary comments are never welcome at this
            wedding. Violent threats or language directed against another person are similarly disallowed.</p>
