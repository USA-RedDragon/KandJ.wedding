            Jacob and I have been together for 8 going on 9 years.
            We first met at Braum's about 10 years ago. At the time,
            I didn't know he liked me. He was a very shy boy at the
            time, so we didn't talk much at first. A friend and I made
            jokes about how cute he was before I knew he liked me.
            It was only after a coworker of ours had overheard him say
            it that I found out. He was turning 16 and I had just turned
            18 when he first asked me out on a date. I said no at first
            due to the age gap, but he didn't give up and I eventually
            said yes. We hit it off from there: we talked all the time,
            and texted just as much. He bought me a promise ring about 4
            years after we started dating and 6 years in he asked me to
            marry him while we were driving home from my mothers house one
            day. When we moved in together, I had 3 cats: Lazy, Lux, and
            Nox. At first, he didn't want any more animals. That was, until
            my mom brought home a foster that she had planned to adopt, but
            we took her in instead. He fell in love with her, so now we have
            a 4th cat named Storm. It has now been almost 9 years and we
            have been together through thick and thin.
